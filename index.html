            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm Chris Stutz, a protein engineer with 10 years of industry experience and a PhD focused on display technologies. I publish under my legal name, Charles Christopher Stutz.</p>
            <p>I lead protein optimization campaigns from strategy through execution, working with teams to coordinate timelines and make sure our work fits into the bigger picture. My technical toolkit includes phage, yeast, and mRNA display across antibodies, TCRs, and macrocyclic peptides.</p>
            <p>I manage cross-functional teams and focus on making sure optimization projects land on time and actually serve the broader program goals—not just generate data for its own sake.</p>

            <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            <p>My research interests primarily lie in fine tuning libraries and selection strategies to fit the needs of the pogram.</p>
